Web banner adverts (Standard sizes)

=================================================================

DESCRIPTION

"The IAB Ad Unit Guidelines are intended for marketers, agencies and media
companies for use in the creating, planning, buying and selling of interactive
marketing and advertising.  The IAB's Ad Sizes Working Group meets on a
bi-annual basis to review proposed new ad units and issue updated voluntary
guidelines as appropriate.

"Publishers
These voluntary guidelines provide a framework for advertising inventory and
web page design. The goal is to reduce and simplify the amount of work for
agencies that may be faced with having to create several assets of a similar
size for different publishers, e.g. 300x95, 300x100, 300x105 pixels.

"The recommended file weights and animation lengths are specifically for animated
in-page display ads, typically using an authoring program such as Adobe Flash or
appearing as animated GIFs."
